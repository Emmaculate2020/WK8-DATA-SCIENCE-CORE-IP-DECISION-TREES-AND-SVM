# WK8-DATA-SCIENCE-CORE-IP-DECISION-TREES-AND-SVM

### Description

- Week 8 Independent Project on Supervised Learning; Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine on hypothyroid dataset.

- The problem statement;

##### Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

##### Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.





### Experimental Design

- Data Understanding through exploration of the dataset.

- Data Cleaning

- Bivariate Analysis

- Decision Trees:-Random Forest

                 - AdaBoost
                 
                 - Gradient Boosting

- Support Vector Machine: - Kernel(Linear)

                          - Kernel(Polynomial)
                          
                          - Kernel(Radial Basis Function)
                          
                          - Kernel(Sigmoid)
